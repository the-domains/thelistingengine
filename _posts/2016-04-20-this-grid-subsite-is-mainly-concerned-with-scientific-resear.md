This grid subsite is mainly concerned with scientific research in nanotechnology, materials science, quantum computing, renewable energy and Brain Machine Interfaces. Also, Space Colonization, Solar System Engineering, and with a general Federovian / Bogdanovite / Verdansky BioCosmist Bent. I think the genesis of the whole thing was this:

So, nothing left to the imagination. NOTHING! [That is a thing, actually][0].

Here is Eric Drexler's annual report on the state of nanotechnology (basically, what pieces and techniques need to be in place to achieve atomically precise manufacturing, and notable developments toward that goal in the past year).
